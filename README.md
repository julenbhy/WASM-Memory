# WASM-Memory

The WebAssembly-Memory Repository is a dedicated resource designed to facilitate in-depth exploration and evaluation of memory management within WebAssembly (Wasm) applications. This repository provides a diverse collection of C programs for researchers and developers seeking to understand and analyze the intricate workings of memory in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios. All programs within this repository are developed and tested using the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) version 20, ensuring compatibility and relevance within the evolving WebAssembly ecosystem.
